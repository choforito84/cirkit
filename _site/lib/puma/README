This directory contains some compressed archives with a current
version of our PUMA-Package and some literature.
You should find the following files:

README		This file

INSTALL		A simple shell-script to unpack the archives and
		to install the package and programs.

puma.tar.gz	The source code to create the package PUMA

example.tar.gz	Two examples to show the usage of the package and
		to give a first impression of the computational power 

doc.tar.gz	Some literature and documentation

============================================================================

The archives contain the following files:

puma.tar.gz:	

	include/puma.h		The header-file of the package.
				All public available member functions are 
				documented in this file. A more detailed 
				description will be available soon.

	src/puma.c		The documented source-code of the package.

	src/graph.c             Graphic functions source-code

	include/tc_time.h	The header-file for functions to measure the
				timing of the package.

	src/tc_time.c		The source-code for the timing-functions.

	bin/makefile		The makefile to create the library-file
				lib/lib_puma.a


example.tar.gz:	

	example/src/test.c	The source-code for a simple test program 
				that shows the usage of the package.

	example/src/puma_shell.c  The source-code for an interactive 
				interface that is used to give a first 
				impression of the computational power of 
				the package.

	example/bin/makefile	The makefile for the programs test and 
				puma_shell. To create these programs the
				library lib/lib_puma.a must already have 
				been created with bin/makefile.
				Both programs can be called with the 
				option '-h' to give a help text. If the 
				program 'puma_shell' is called with the 
				option '-sh' the interactive shell is entered. 
				There the list of commands can be obtained by 
				the 'h'-command.

	example/bin/rd53
	example/bin/add6 
	example/bin/*.blif	Some benchmarks for testing the package. 
				The full benchmark set for LGSynth93 is
				available from <mcnc.org>.


doc.tar.gz:

	doc/DAC94.ps		A ps-file of the basis article on OKFDDs 
				published at the Design Automation Conference 
				1994, San Diego. 

	doc/PACKAGE.ps		A brief summary of the package that describes 
				some features and gives references to further 
				published work. 

============================================================================

The package has been tested on different computers, i.e.:

- SUN Sparc 
- HP 9000
- PC 386 under Linux

Hardware requirements: 4 MB memory and 2 MB harddisc

For the developement of the package we used g++, 
the GNU project C++ Compiler (version 2.7.1).

============================================================================

Changes in OKFDD-Package PUMA V2.18:

!!! The functions OKFDD_ID(utnode*) and OKFDD_Label(utnode*) did not
    work correct for inverted edges on all machines. Now, the last bit
    of the pointers are masked before evaluation.

!!! In function OKFDD_Synthesis() the second operand was set to OKFDD_ONE 
    even for synthesis-operations with two arguments. Therefore, the 
    synthesized functions were not correct. This bug has been fixed.

!!! The functions counting the number of 1-paths returned the correct 
    values, but for negative Davio-nodes the output files were not correct.
    The corresponding functions have been modified.

  + A directory structure for the different files has been introduced.
    The header-files and the library are located in subdirectories now.
    A special subdirectory for the examples exists.

  + tc_time.h is included in puma.h. Therefore, it is not necessary to
    include tc_time.h in applications but it suffices to include puma.h.

  + puma.h has been reformated to 80 colums.

  + The definitions of 'uchar' 'usint' 'ulint' 'ut_max' 'name_limit' 
    have been deleted in puma.c, since they are defined in puma.h

  + The definitions of 'm_and' has been moved from puma.c to puma.h

  + The file tc_time.cc has been renamed to tc_time.c.

  + The -s flag for the linker have been removed in the makefile
    to allow debugging of applications.

============================================================================

Changes in OKFDD-Package PUMA V2.19:

!!! Control flags for some pointers have not been reset correctly, 
    causing segmentation faults during DTL-Sifting.

  + The files tc_time.h and tc_time.c have been modified, to make the 
    functions to measure the timing also available under Solaris of SUN.

============================================================================

Changes in OKFDD-Package PUMA V2.20:

!!! Extra flags for traversal procedures and decomposition type changes 
    are introduced. Now, synthesis procedures and likewise functions (that
    create and delete nodes) can be performed during traversal procedures.

  + Parameter OKFDD_New_Table_Size introduced for setting of unique table
    size with procedure OKFDD_Resize_ut.

  + All private members of puma classes are changed to protected members.
    Now the protected elements can be accessed by derived classes.

  + OKFDD_Read_BLIF is more flexible with different BLIF-file descriptions.

============================================================================

Changes in OKFDD-Package PUMA V2.21:

!!! Compilation with GNU C++ versions up to 2.7.1 possible

  + Layout of sourcecode changed to 80 columns

============================================================================

Changes in OKFDD-Package PUMA V2.22:

!!! Some allocation / deallocation problems solved

!!! Improvements of Friedman algorithms (only technical stuff)

  + Visualization of OKFDDs possible by procedures XShowDD, XShowDD_all and
    XShowDD_mult and via command 'X' in user-shell
